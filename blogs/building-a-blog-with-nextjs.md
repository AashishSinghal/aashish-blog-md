# Building a Blog with Next.js and Markdown

In this tutorial, we'll build a blog using Next.js and Markdown files for content.

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that's easy to write and read. It's perfect for blog content because:

- It's simple to learn
- It converts easily to HTML
- It's widely supported
- It works well with version control

## Setting Up the Project

First, create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-blog
cd my-blog
```
