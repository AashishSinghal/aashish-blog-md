# TypeScript Best Practices for 2023

TypeScript continues to grow in popularity, and for good reason. Here are some best practices to follow in 2023.

## Use Strict Mode

Always enable strict mode in your TypeScript configuration:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

## Prefer Interfaces Over Types

Interfaces are often more flexible and can be extended more easily:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
}

interface AdminUser extends User {
  permissions: string[];
}
```
